(ns payroll.operation
  "OperationActor — one payroll-run/filing/disclosure/dispute operation =
  one supervised actor run, expressed as a langgraph-clj StateGraph. The
  advisor (PayrollProcessor-LLM) is sealed into a single node (:advise);
  its proposal is ALWAYS routed through the PayrollGovernor (:govern) and
  the rollout phase gate (:decide) before anything commits to the SSoT or
  is filed.

  One graph run = one operation. No unbounded inner loop.

  Human-in-the-loop = real approval / dispute-review workflow:
  `interrupt-before #{:request-approval}` pauses the actor and hands the
  decision to a human reviewer (compliance officer). The reviewer resumes
  with `{:approval {:status :approved}}` (or `:rejected`)."
